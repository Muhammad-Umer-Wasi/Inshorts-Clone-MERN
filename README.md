# Inshorts Clone - MERN Stack

**Description:**
This GitHub repository contains a complete clone of the popular news aggregator website, Inshorts, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project aims to replicate the core functionality and user interface of Inshorts, providing users with a platform to browse and read summarized news articles.

**Key Features:**
- Backend built with Node.js and Express, serving as the server to handle incoming requests from the frontend.
- MongoDB used as the database to store news articles and relevant information.
- Frontend developed using React, a powerful JavaScript library, to create an interactive and responsive user interface.
- Clean and intuitive design, allowing users to easily browse through the latest news articles.
- Each article is displayed as a card with a headline, author, short description, timestamp, and an option to read more on the original source.
- Axios used as the HTTP client to handle API requests and responses between the frontend and backend.
- Users can post new articles on the website using a simple form, and the data is stored in the MongoDB database.
- Deployment on Heroku, making the website accessible to a wider audience.
